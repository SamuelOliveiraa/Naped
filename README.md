## WELCOME! ðŸ‘‹

This is a challenge proposed by the website **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** and this site is great because it helps us improve our **coding skills** with real projects and more varied difficulties. The site gives us the possibility to train any skill or web technology that we want, be it media-querie, grid layout, Jquery, React, etc..

## The Challenge ðŸŽ¯

This challenge is to reproduce this **Fylo dark theme landing page** as close as possible to the original design.

In this challenge my biggest difficulty was to implement the smooth scrolling of the page with pure JavaScript, in no way I was able to make it work, with that I had to use the Jquery library and only with it I was able to make the scrolling work the way I wanted.The email validation I was able to do only with pure JavaScript.
